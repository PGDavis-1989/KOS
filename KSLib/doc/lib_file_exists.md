``lib_file_exists.ks`` Is a means of checking for optional dependencies. Or checking whether a file exists before attempting to run it. 


### file_exists

  * True or false depending on whether the file in question is on the current volume.
  
description:
  * This is intended to be used as a means to check if an attempt to run a file will succeed or fail before attempting do do so.
